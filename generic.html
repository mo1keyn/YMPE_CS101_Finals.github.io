									<h1>Who Is...<br />
									Yuan Matthew Enriquez?</h1>
									<p>"He's quite a lot of things, though he prefers to be quiet about it. He says he's a disappointment and the spitting image of a what-if... but I disagree. God always has a plan for everyone, even if they don't know it, and Yuan believes in it as he thinks that it's up to you to make up for your screwups after life throws a curveball at you.".</p>

								<p>Born in Pasig City in a hospital along Marcos Highway, Yuan Matthew Enriquez was a very strange baby. At a young age, he's somehow unable to learn the native language of Tagalog and was subjected to learn English instead. Also at a young age, he was a very hyperactive and emotional kid... pretty typical, but he was one of the odd ones among the other kids in his neighborhood due to being fluent in English from the getgo. He was inspired to draw lots of things that he thought about in his head, to the point that he carried on a dream of becoming an artist and then eventually an animator when he gets older. Throughout his life, he was a bit of a borderline autist due to his hyperfixation on doing anything that satisfies his cravings like drawing during classes and lectures. His passion grew big as he got older, but not to the point of absurdity, as he mostly stayed in his lane.</p>
								<p>By the time he got to college, he was dead set on doing all he can to learn on how to become an animator, but that'd change on 2022 when family matters interfered with his plans. This set him back a lot, even for almost 3 years due to losing momentum after non-stop schooling since pre-school days, so he decided to rethink his life goals and the like while giving himself a year's worth of rest. Thanks to his friends enrolling to CIIT and taking up BSEMC, along with really good word-to-mouth from them, he decided to go study there as his next course of action in his life. 3 months later, and he's been the most fulfilled he's ever been but not without any hiccups from his near-3 years of NEET behavior rearing its ugly head. It'll take time for him to truly be back in the game, especially sicne he's a fish out of water, but he's determined and more motivated than ever.</p>
